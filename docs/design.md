## delfino

- a **visualization** or **viz** is a collection of *frames* that is *served* to an end-user according to a specified *vorm*
- a **frame** is a spatial arrangement of media *elements*
- an **element** is the smallest unit of media a *viz* can offer (e.g. a specific image, an audio clip)
- to **serve** a *frame* is to render its content to the end-user (i.e. show it on the web page)
- a **vorm** is a spatial and temporal arrangement of *frames*

- *vorm* = viz form (and still sounds like "form")
- a *frame* is an open canvas; all of its *elements* can be spatially arranged however (?drag-and-drop)

- viz
